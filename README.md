## Your place in the Space.

### author: Mateusz Murak

This project is a website dedicated for astronomy passionates. It is intended to allow building a society of amateur astronomers and serve the content they create.

Main concerns of Space-r are functionalities of a blog, photo gallery and an event calendar. Currently, as for February 2023, the last one is best developed, as blog and photo gallery need more care.

All artwork has been handcrafted by application author.
