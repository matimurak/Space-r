# Space-r
## Your place in the Space.

This project is a website dedicated for astronomy passionates. It is intended to allow building a society of amateur astronomers and serve the content they create.

Main concerns of Space-r are functionalities of a blog, photo gallery and an event calendar. Currently, as for February 2023, the last one is the best developed, as blog and photo gallery need more care.
